# basic-tween-animation-library
An animation library I made to learn how to do animations. A blog post about it can be found at [ben-knight.dev](https://ben-knight.dev).


## How to use

To run this, do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm install` in the directory
3. run `npm run dev` - a vite server will start up with a cube animation moving across the screen.
